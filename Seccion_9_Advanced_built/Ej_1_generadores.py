"""
Take a look at the code in the problem description where we test if a number is prime.
Refactor the code and put it into the function below to turn the prime_generator() function into a generator.

Implement your generator so that others can get a prime number generator like this:

g = prime_generator(100)    # g can generate prime numbers under 100
next(g) # get next prime like this

Reminder: you don't need to change the function name nor the argument
